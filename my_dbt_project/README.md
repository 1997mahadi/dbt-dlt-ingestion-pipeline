## ðŸ“„ Overview

This project aims to transform and analyze cryptocurrency data. It includes models for raw data, metadata, and purchase data. The project utilizes DBT to ensure data quality and maintainability.

### Models

- **clean_crypto_data.sql**: Model to clean and transform raw cryptocurrency data.
- **crypto_data.sql**: Model for raw cryptocurrency trading data.
- **dim_metadata.sql**: Dimensional table for metadata about the data load.
- **dim_symbols.sql**: Dimensional table for cryptocurrency symbols.
- **dim_time.sql**: Dimensional table for time attributes (optional).
- **distinct_symbols.sql**: Model to extract distinct cryptocurrency symbols.
- **fact_crypto_prices.sql**: Fact table for cryptocurrency prices.
- **fact_purchases.sql**: Fact table for cryptocurrency purchases.
- **metadata.sql**: Model for metadata about the data load period.
- **purchases.sql**: Model for purchase details of cryptocurrencies.
- **timestamps.sql**: Model for time attributes.

### Data Quality Tests

This project includes various tests to ensure data quality, such as:

- Not null tests for critical fields.
- Unique tests for primary keys.
- Relationships tests to ensure referential integrity.
